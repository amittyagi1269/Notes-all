#Create and Attach Block Volume:

#Create a block volume in the OCI Console and note down its OCID.
#Attach the block volume to the instance you want to mount it on.
#Install Required Packages:
#Connect to your OCI instance and install the required packages:


sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install open-iscsi
#Discover and Connect to the Target:
#Run the following commands to discover the iSCSI targets and connect to the target:


sudo iscsiadm -m discovery -t sendtargets -p <target_ip>
sudo iscsiadm -m node -T <iqn_name> -p <target_ip> -l
#Replace <target_ip> with the IP address of the iSCSI target and <iqn_name> with the target's IQN (iSCSI Qualified Name).

#Check the Discovered Devices:
#You can check the newly discovered iSCSI devices using the lsblk command:

lsblk
Format and Mount the Volume:
Format the iSCSI device using a filesystem of your choice. For example, to format it as ext4 and mount it:

bash
Copy code
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX   # Replace sdX with the appropriate device name
sudo mkdir /mnt/myvolume
sudo mount /dev/sdX /mnt/myvolume   # Replace sdX with the appropriate device name
Update /etc/fstab (Optional but Recommended):
To ensure the volume is mounted automatically after reboots, add an entry to the /etc/fstab file:

bash
Copy code
echo "/dev/sdX /mnt/myvolume ext4 defaults 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab   # Replace sdX and /mnt/myvolume with appropriate values
Remember to replace placeholders like <target_ip>, <iqn_name>, sdX, and /mnt/myvolume with actual values that match your environment.

Please exercise caution when making changes to your system, especially when working with storage devices and filesystems. Always have backups and double-check the commands you're executing.
