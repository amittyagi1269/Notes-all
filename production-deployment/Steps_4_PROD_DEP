# Production in Deployment in Rhel 9

# First Step is to connect the Rhel server and update the server.
yum update -y

# Second Mandatory step is to check the firewalld status .
systemctl status firewalld
# if the firewalld status is active then disable it otherwise it will not let your application run and give u 403 error.

#third Mandatory step is to check the Selinux status.
[root@serverX ~]# getenforce
Enforcing
[root@serverX ~]# setenforce
usage: setenforce [ Enforcing | Permissive | 1 | 0 ]
[root@serverX ~]# setenforce 0
[root@serverX ~]# getenforce
Permissive
[root@serverX ~]# setenforce Enforcing
[root@serverX ~]# getenforce
Enforcing
# selinux status should be permissive to run the application. 

# Fourth mandatory step is to change the hostname to hide your server private ip. command used to change the host name is : -
hostnamectl set-hostname application-1
# to check the hostname , command used is 
hostname 
# To refresh the kernel of linux the command used is : 
bash
# To check the version of kernel the command used is :
uname -r
# to check the ports the commands used is :
netstat -tunlp
# to check the rpm the command is :
yum repolist
# path of the repo is :
cd /etc/yum.repos.d
#to check the repos the command is 
rpm -qa | grep httpd   # anythind that you have installed .
# to search anything there is a command :
find / -name httpd.conf   # httpd.conf is the file name that is searched through this command. 
#there are many command which need to searched that is present in the os nor not . command used for that is 
which
# next step is to install the opensource repository for rhel that epel-repo to download the packages on rhel. the link is below :

https://www.tecmint.com/install-epel-repo-rhel-9/#:~:text=What%20is%20EPEL%20Repository%3F,which%20also%20includes%20RHEL%209.

# after installing rpel successfull you can install the webserver accordingly. for example 
yum install httpd -y 
systemctl status httpd
systemctl enable httpd
systemclt start httpd 
systemctl status httpd

#webserver httpd status should be active. 
#check the port by netstat -tunlp . it will reflect the listening port of 80. 

#now check the webserver is working or not by hitting the public ip. if the web server is not working . the things to be checked are :

1. httpd service is active or not. ====== systemctl status httpd.
2. firewalld service should be inactive === systemctl status firewalld ( make it inactive by systemctl stop firewalld).
3. selinux service should be permissive == setenforce - setenforce 0 - getenforce - permissive.
4. Also check the ports that is netstat -tunlp  . it will show the listening ports with the services running. if the port is not listening then. 
5. Go to the console and go to the security group and add the port in inbound to open the port so that the service will start listening that port now.
